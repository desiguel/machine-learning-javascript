# Machine Learning using JavaScript

This is a small project which shows how to implement basic machine learning models in JavaScript with comparison files in R.

# Installation Notes

For JS:

Make sure you have NodeJS installed, clone the repo, install the dependencies listed in package.json, navigate to source/JS/ then run either of the following:

> node logistic_regression_simple.js

> node neural_net_simple.js

For R:

Open the included R project file in RStudio, then run either logistic_regression_simple.r or mlp_simple.r.
